The architects of Node’s API
liked PubSub so much that they decided to include a generic PubSub entity
called EventEmitter that other objects can inherit from.


From a software architecture perspective, jQuery publishes the link element’s
events to anyone who wants to subscribe. That’s why it’s called “PubSub.” ( jQuery is PubSub)
