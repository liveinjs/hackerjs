A class can have any number of static initialization blocks, and they can appear anywhere in the class body. 

The runtime system guarantees that static initialization blocks are called in the order that they appear in the source code.

----------------------------------------


Initializing Instance Members
The Java compiler copies initializer blocks into every constructor. 
Therefore, this approach can be used to share a block of code between multiple constructors.
